# TRAA Midterm Presentation Review

Going over some stuff that almost everyone got slightly wrong. 

## Description

An in-depth paragraph about your project and overview of use.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and HTML5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [CanIUse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference). Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation (or an NPM script).

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
